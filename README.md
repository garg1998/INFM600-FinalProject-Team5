During the early stages of the pandemic, public attention shifted to tenant protections and vulnerabilities in the face of mass job loss and a public health emergency. Officials issued eviction moratoriums, rent freezes, and other tenant protection policies, but lacked clear methods for enforcement. But this isn’t a new problem – illegal eviction, building code violations, and illegal rent hikes are commonplace in the U.S., yet municipalities lack access to data to enforce tenant safeguards. In many jurisdictions, leaders do not know how many rental units exist or have a cohesive method for tracking who owns those units. 

We propose creating a simple rental housing registry data system that cities and other communities can deploy to track critical information about rental housing units. Our information service would function as a framework that incorporates best practices outlined by housing policy experts and tenant advocates, thereby minimizing startup time for resource-strapped municipalities and creating a degree of standardization in the rental industry. The primary purposes of this data system are landlord oversight, tenant right protection enforcement, tenant outreach, and greater insight for leaders and policymakers.
